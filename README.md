# 🌍 Weather Forecasting Web App (PHP + MySQL + OpenWeatherMap)

## 📌 Project Concept
This project is a **weather forecasting web application** built with **PHP, MySQL, and the OpenWeatherMap API**.  
The app allows users to:
- Add city names to a database
- Fetch live weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, description)
- Display results with a clean interface using Bulma CSS
- Delete cities from the list when no longer needed

The main idea is to combine **database management** with **real-time API integration** so users can store their favorite cities and instantly check the weather.
